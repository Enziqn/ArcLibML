A header Only library focuesed on Machine Learning tools

Hello this is my first repo and library, Its still very new, and their might be issues.
The main purpose of this repo is to create tools for poeple to create simple Machine learning programs.
The library is also header only, while not compiled it will let people see the code clearly, and hopefully encourage more contributors.
